2. Smart Contracts are transaction protocols on the blockchain which execute terms of a contract. They are speedy,  extremely secure, and - for better or worse - irreversible once deployed.
3. Transactions are used to change blockchain data while Scripts are used merely to view blockchain data. 


# Chapter 1, Day 2:
The Pillars of Cadence programming language (& their usefulness!)

1. Safety and Security - self-explanatory; should be the hallmark of any smart contract language worth its muster!  
2. Clarity - code that is simple for developers to express intent and readers to comprehend serve to ensure safety 
3. Approachability - Similarities in syntax to other programming languages ensures a low barrier to entry for interested software developers.	
4. Developer Experience - clarity in error messages will help developers debug sans frustration. 
5. Resource Oriented Programming
